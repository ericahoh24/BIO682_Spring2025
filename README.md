# Quantitative Biology (BIO 682), Spring 2025
- This is the primary repository for course materials, and will be updated regularly. 
- Please make sure to "pull" updates to your personal machine prior to class each week. 

### Class time/location
Friday 12:45 - 3:15 pm, Science Annex room 104.

### Office hours
TBD
    
### Course Description
As datasets continue to increase in complexity, computational analysis is becoming a routine part of scientific research. This is a hands-on training course that teaches you how to use general computing tools to work more efficiently and effectively in the biological sciences. This course will cover a broad range of powerful and flexible tools including text file manipulation with regular expressions, interacting with a command line interface, basic shell scripting, programming in Python, and basic graphical concepts.

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
1. Apply computer science techniques to test biological hypotheses. (NACE Competencies: Technology, Critical Thinking)

2. Write custom scripts and utilize existing software packages to address questions in their research. (NACE Competencies: Technology, Critical Thinking)

3. Use computer science techniques to answer biological questions with real data. (NACE Competencies: Technology, Critical Thinking)

4. Effectively communicate their interpretation and analysis of biological data using computer science techniques. (NACE Competencies: Communication, Professionalism)

### Required Text
Haddock, S. H. D. and Dunn, C. W. (2010). Practical Computing for Biologists. [Sinauer Associates](http://practicalcomputing.org)

Assigned reading should be completed **prior to each class**. This will allow us to minimize time spent in lectures and maximize hands-on time actively using the new tools being presented. 

### Useful Links
[Appendices](http://practicalcomputing.org/files/PCfB_Appendices.pdf) from the Practical Computing for Biologists book, which summarize frequently used commands.
